# As of April 9th, 2022, the Compliance Team has rebranded to Faithful, along with all of our projects.


Faithful was never officially licensed to xMrVizzy, also known as Kraineff, for use or for commercial gain. As such, Vattic has asked him to cease and desist use of the Faithful name, remove it from the Minecraft Bedrock Marketplace, and cease development of his version of the pack. Vattic has turned over use to the makers of Classic Faithful (Formerly EM) and Compliance (Now Faithful) to continue Faithful officially as a community-run project. 

# If you are currently using Kraineff's fraudulent pack, we would like to ask you to stop using it, since that directly supports Kraineff. 

Additionally, it is recommended to leave his Discord server as soon as possible for the same reason. Faithful is now being run by what was Compliance and Emulated Vattic, now Faithful and Classic Faithful respectively. The only official website where you can find Faithful is at the bottom of this page.

# What does this mean for the packs?

There will not be any changes to Compliance, aside from branding. We want to make this as clear as possible: Our founding values of being a non-profit, open-source, community-driven resource pack that allows anyone to contribute is what makes our community and resource packs so great. We will never step away from those key values.

The rebrand will roll out over time, meaning that while the easiest stuff has already been completed there still might be a few things that will use legacy branding for the time being.

## Our new GitHub organization is at https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack with our main site at https://faithfulpack.net.
